### A Different Way

The goal is to make good things, support the open source community wherever possible, and put people over profits. systemBlue strives to collect as little user data as possible and always gives the user the final say over their data. Delete buttons are just that. 

systemBlue is also committed to providing critical resources to shelters and vulnerable communities in Charlottesville. Resources are donated as they become available to the company. If you'd like to collaborate in serving the community, please send an email to: hello@systemblue.io.
